# New Operation System

## Current state of the world
Today there are dozen AI applications attempting to maximize productivity, if its for buissness (e.g Insider) or a consumer (e.g Grammerly).
Alongside this trend, ChatGPT and others had reduced the bridge between the averge consumer i.e your mom and AI.
Leaving the current state of the world in a huge set of opportunities to change how human and machine interact.

## What its missing and why?
I specificly said "How Human and Machine Interact" because its not just a buissnes opportunity,
its an attempt to close the final mile of integrating Human and Machine.
People are already walking with their phones everywhere they go, then how much more we can realy integrate Human and Machine?
A legitimate question but its not the right one to ask yourselfs and here is why. How much resources do you think you utilize from your phone? 100%? 90%?
Lets break it down to a list

..* Whatsapp, Telegram, Messanger, SMS, etc.. (Communicating via messages)
..* Instegram, Facebook, X(Twitter), Snapchat, etc.. (Social Media)
..* Phone calls
..* Waze, Google Maps, etc.. (Navigation)
..* Clash of Clans, Brawl Stars, etc.. (Gaming)
..* Asus, AliExpress, Amazon, etc.. (Shopping)

I have listed the most common ways people interact with their phone (Machine), now can you tell me how much do you think you utilize your phone resources?
When you think about it its essentially 0 (unless you are gaming).
Most of the time your phone is ideal doing nothing, well the last statement is a bit questionable, almost for certin the operating system provider your phone is running on is gathering data on you wether you like it or not.
Its not realy being idle just sitting there,
its gathering data that is own by you without any permission, even if you allowed them to gather this data you will not see how this investment will yeild any
return for you.

So not only there's a security issue, most people dont fully utilize their machines.

## Solution
In order to solve the problems we have stated we will have to create a new Operating System.
This OS will not be a regular OS it must come in the shape of something revolutionary, it must make a quantom leap with how Human and Machine interact.
At first its something that is hard to imagine, how this OS will look like? feel? whats its going to do different?
I hope I will be able to answer these questions for you with my proposed solution. 

Lets try to imagine what it means to close the last mile with how Human and Machine interact.
We want the machine (phone) will be an extension of our biological body just like we have arms, legs, etc, but, the beauty of machines
is that we can alter them to our needs specificly quite easily, we can also remove and add how many machines we want.
Imagine how nice it would be to be able switch your limb or kidney if they fail or start to malfunction. Well we can do that with machines.

Now just like your biological body parts are communicating with one another essentily about every little detail that is happening inside you we can do with the machine exetensions,
they will communicate with one another about every little detail that they can ?sense? (or you told them to sense), all of these details (data points) will be communicated to your other extensions
where they can do whatever they were told to do with that data. These extensions will be sold by IoT companies providing the physical devices with their own capabilities.
(You can say, well I have seen all of these scifi analogies in ehe Movies, but dont forget that we are talking about a concrete solution)

An emergent proprty from the machine extensions is the ?ability to store huge amounts of *personalized* data?, which can then be used to train an AI models. Just like your brain
have sections with "domain" expertiese which are making decisions according to the data points it gets from your nervous system, these AI models will be an extension of your brain, so what applied
to the machine extensions also applies to your brain extensions, they are modular. We will call these brain extensions "Plugins" these Plugins will be sold by AI developers. But the key note here
is that the data the model is going to be fine tuned with is your personalized data and every new data point will make it more tuned to your personalize experiences.

You can tell me "Tomer, I understand how it may function, but how its going to feel/look for the end user?" So with the understanding that the smart phones could not be replaced in the near 
future we are going to use them into our advantage. We are going to use them as our mediator to our extensions, imagine an application or even better a new OS on your phone that
will allow you to communicate with your extensions i.e see their status and configuration. Just to put ourselfs in the right context an app like "Whatsapp" is an extension, this extension is leaving
inside another extension which is your phone meanings we can have a composition of extensions from one extension. Now you will tell me that you imagine a person with a phone conrolling whatsapp
through a proxy, but this new OS is not something we can imagine freely, the act of imagining something that does not exists yet is hard, but you can start to appreciate
the emergent propties that will be gained by gathering all of the experiences you go through and use them in order to create new tools for yourself and humanity. I cant tell exactly how these
tools will look like I can only postulate i.e there will be a device that can sense your heartbeat, fat, and more physiological properties over time and use that to create your diet and trainig but not only that
it can also order your groceries accordingly or even order from a resturant a weak before making the meal much less expensive.

for first the smart phones will not go anywhere soon, meaning we have to use them
in order to on board users, but keep in mind that in the future the smart phones will look very differntly. After we have clarified this one lets continue with another analogy.
